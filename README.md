# Bookable - Book Display site
[Live Version](https://bookable-jane.herokuapp.com/)
> Books Database Website build with NodeJS, MongoDB and Express

## General info
Bookable is a book database website with the possibilities of adding, editing and deleting both books and authors.
The project was built with JavaScript, Express, NodeJS and MongoDB database.
In this project I faced a struggle setting all the routes for the different options, but I've learned a lot about connecting databases and the components themselves on the website.
My inspiration was my love for books, and I thought it was a great idea to practice backend development with this concept.
